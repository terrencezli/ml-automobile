## Machine Learning Prediction Model for Automobiles

> A couple of machine learning algorithms utilizing the UCI dataset to predict automobile attributes

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The project requires the following major dependencies:

- python 2.7
- pip

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your python version.

```sh
python -V
```

2) Install all the dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Python scripts

 ```sh
 python <file-name>
 ```

## Concept

We are apply the different machine learning algorithm concepts on the UCI automobile dataset.

Given the 26 attributes, are we able to accurately predict the pricing of inputted car.
The whole concept of this project is that we are looking to identify:

1) Which attributes are more valuable to solving our problem?

2) Which attributes are least valuable to solving our problem?

3) What are the list of attributes that create the highest accuracy count?

4) What are the list of attributes that create the lowest accuracy count?

5) What model is most suitable for this problem?

6) What model is least suitable for this problem?
